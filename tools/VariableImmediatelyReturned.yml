pr_body: |
  Declaring a variable only to immediately return or throw it is a *bad practice*. Some developers argue that
  the practice improves code readability, because it enables them to explicitly name what is being returned.

  The **method name should be sufficient** for callers to know exactly what will be returned.

  The reason is not performance, but readability. [More details here.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31734226)
